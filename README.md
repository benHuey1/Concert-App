# Concert-App (*Under construction*🛠️)

Here's my project of a concert ticketing platform. The user can see (factice) coming concerts from different cities in Belgium.There is a part for artist where you can found description, pictures and upcoming concerts. And finally a part for concert halls with localisation and description. 

The use experience is divided into 2 parts : 
- Artist part: the user can signup as an artist and create concert event. 🎵
- Public part : the user can signup as a public and add some concert event to his own cart. 🛒
